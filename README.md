# Radar-detector-using-Arduino
The primary objective of this project is to design, build, and program a radar detector that can effectively detect the presence and distance of objects in its vicinity. We utilize an Arduino microcontroller to control the radar system, taking advantage of its versatility and ease of programming. The radar detector employs ultrasonic or microwave sensors to transmit and receive signals, enabling it to calculate the distance to an object accurately.

The Circuit diagram, Schematic diagram, Block diagram are available in PPT.
