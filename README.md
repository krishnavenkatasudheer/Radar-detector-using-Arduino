# Radar-detector-using-Arduino
The primary objective of this project is to design, build, and program a radar detector that can effectively detect the presence and distance of objects in its vicinity. The radar detector employs ultrasonic or microwave sensors to transmit and receive signals, enabling it to calculate the distance to an object accurately.
